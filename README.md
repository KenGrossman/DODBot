# DODBot

I created this project as a take home interview assignment.
This project currently automates 4 tests on the website https://apps.dtic.mil/dodinvestment/#/advancedSearch 
I plan on adding more automation in time

Setup:
1. Download Google Chrome Selenium Driver from https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
2. Unzip file and place driver into folder of your choosing 
3. Update driverPath variable with your folder path
4. Run Program in terminal using 'python3 DODInvestmentBot.py'

TODO:
1. Automate more test cases
2. Refractor code to be more object oriented
